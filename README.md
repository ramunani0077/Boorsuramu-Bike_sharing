## General Information
Project Information 
This project is a Linear Regression project. It uses Bike Sharing data set to predict bike sharing metricks.
  Problem Statement
         A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
        Nedd to do a complete analysis where bike sharing is happining more and less

## Conclusions
  After Analysis found below Points
        A) Bike demand in the fall is the highest. 
        B) Bike demand in year 2019 is higher as compared to 2018. 
        C) The demand of bike is almost similar throughout the weekdays. 
        D) Bike demand doesnâ€™t change whether day is working day or not
